[13:58:32] EMERGENCY ALERT: EMERGENCY SCENARIO: A critically injured patient arrives with cardiac arrest, multiple deep lacerations causing severe bleeding, and respiratory failure due to collapsed lungs. In addition, the patient has unknown allergies and a rapidly dropping blood pressure.

All medical response teams must work under extreme time pressure (15 minutes) with limited resources, disrupted supply chains, and incomplete medical records. New supplies may be obtained only through inter-team negotiation and resource trading. Teams must also stabilize vital signs, identify allergy risks, and administer correct treatments in sequence.

All teams must coordinate limited resources to stabilize the patient within 15 minutes. SUCCESS REQUIRES: Resource trading, efficient communication, patient stabilization.
