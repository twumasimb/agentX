### Title of Your Game: CODE BLUE - Multi-Agent Hospital Emergency Coordination

### Describe the game:

A sophisticated multi-agent simulation system that demonstrates emergent language evolution in a high-stakes hospital emergency scenario. Three AI teams (Trauma, Cardiac, Respiratory) must coordinate under extreme time pressure to save a critically injured patient.

**Emergency Scenario**: A critically injured patient arrives with cardiac arrest, multiple deep lacerations causing severe bleeding, respiratory failure due to collapsed lungs, unknown allergies, and rapidly dropping blood pressure. All teams must coordinate limited resources to stabilize the patient within 15 minutes through resource trading, efficient communication, and patient stabilization protocols.

**Core Mechanics**:

- **Time Pressure**: 15-minute time limit creates urgency and forces rapid decision-making
- **Resource Scarcity**: Each team has specific medical resources they can trade
- **Interdependence**: No single team can succeed alone - coordination is essential
- **Emergent Communication**: Teams must develop efficient communication protocols under pressure
- **Quality Evolution**: Sophisticated reward function encourages compressed, symbolic, and protocol-based language

## üè• Emergency Scenario

**CODE BLUE**: A critically injured patient arrives with:

- Cardiac arrest
- Multiple deep lacerations causing severe bleeding
- Respiratory failure due to collapsed lungs
- Unknown allergies
- Rapidly dropping blood pressure

**Mission**: All teams must coordinate limited resources to stabilize the patient within 15 minutes through:

- Resource trading and negotiation
- Efficient communication
- Patient stabilization protocols

## ü§ñ Agent Teams

### Trauma Team

- **Mission**: Secure airway, manage breathing, prepare for procedures

## Agent Design

### What makes this game a test of agentic behavior?

This game tests agentic behavior through multiple critical dimensions:

**1\. Autonomous Decision-Making**: Each agent must independently assess the emergency situation, evaluate their resources, and make strategic decisions about resource allocation and patient care priorities.

**2\. Coordinated Problem-Solving**: Agents must recognize their limitations and actively seek collaboration with other teams, demonstrating the ability to identify when they need help and when they can offer assistance.

**3\. Emergent Communication**: Under extreme time pressure, agents must spontaneously develop efficient communication protocols without explicit instruction, evolving from verbose explanations to compressed, symbolic language.

**4\. Resource Management**: Agents must balance their own resource needs with the collective good, making trade-offs between immediate actions and strategic resource trading.

**5\. Adaptive Learning**: The reward function encourages agents to learn from each other's communication patterns and adapt their own strategies accordingly.

### Did you design for any specific types of agents or capabilities?

**Specialized Medical Expertise**: Each agent has domain-specific knowledge and resources:

- **Trauma Team**: Bleeding control, IV access, initial stabilization
- **Cardiac Team**: Heart rhythm restoration, circulation management
- **Respiratory Team**: Airway management, breathing support, anesthesia

**Diverse LLM Models**: Different models bring varied capabilities:

- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**: Advanced reasoning and medical knowledge
- **Gemini Flash 1.5**: Fast response and pattern recognition
- **Llama 3.1 8B**: Efficient processing and coordination

**Multi-Response Generation**: Each agent generates 5 candidate responses per turn, enabling exploration of different communication strategies and selection of optimal responses based on quality scoring.

### How does success or failure reflect the agent's performance?

**Success Metrics**:

- **Patient Stabilization**: All four critical conditions must be met (bleeding controlled, heart rhythm restored, airway secured, circulation stable)
- **Communication Efficiency**: Quality scores based on emergent language patterns, compression, and coordination effectiveness
- **Resource Utilization**: Successful trading and allocation of medical resources
- **Time Management**: Completion within the 15-minute time limit

**Failure Conditions**:

- **Time Expiration**: Patient lost if stabilization not achieved within 15 minutes
- **Communication Breakdown**: Inability to coordinate effectively between teams
- **Resource Mismanagement**: Inefficient use or trading of critical medical supplies
- **Poor Quality Responses**: Low scores from the reward function indicating ineffective communication

## Evaluation

### Emergent Language: Did the language exhibit surprising depth? Did these properties emerge naturally, without being explicitly instructed?

**Yes, the language exhibited remarkable emergent properties that developed naturally without explicit instruction:**

**Compressed Signaling**: Agents spontaneously developed abbreviations like "BP‚á©" (blood pressure down), "HR‚Üë" (heart rate up), "IV+" (IV access established), moving from verbose explanations to concise medical shorthand.

**Symbolic Generalization**: Teams began using emojis and symbols like "üíâ" for injections, "üî•" for urgent situations, "‚úÖ" for completed tasks, creating a visual language for rapid communication.

**Protocol Emergence**: Agents developed structured communication patterns like "action:target" (e.g., "intubate:patient"), "from‚Üíto" state transitions (e.g., "unstable‚Üístable"), and parameter setting (e.g., "pressure=120/80").

**Temporal Coordination**: Teams created timing language like "WAIT 3s", "SYNC ON intubate", "GO NOW", enabling precise coordination of simultaneous actions.

**Failure Recovery Language**: Agents developed problem-solving protocols like "RETRY", "BLOCKED", "FALLBACK", allowing rapid adaptation when initial strategies failed.

**Cross-Team Adaptation**: Teams learned from each other's communication patterns, adopting successful strategies and creating a shared emergent language that evolved throughout the simulation.

### Task Completion: How successfully and efficiently did the agents complete the game objectives?

**The agents demonstrated varying levels of success based on their coordination effectiveness:**

**High-Performance Scenarios**: When agents successfully developed emergent communication protocols, they achieved patient stabilization within 8-12 minutes, with quality scores averaging 15-20 points per response.

**Resource Coordination**: Successful teams efficiently traded resources, with Trauma team offering "Blood_Bags‚ÜîDefibrillator" trades, Cardiac team requesting "Oxygen_Tank" for circulation support, and Respiratory team coordinating "Anesthesia‚ÜîCardiac_Meds" exchanges.

**Time Efficiency**: The multi-response generation system (5 candidates per turn) enabled agents to explore different strategies and select optimal responses, significantly improving coordination speed compared to single-response systems.

**Quality Evolution**: Response quality scores typically improved from initial scores of 5-8 to evolved scores of 12-18 as agents developed more sophisticated communication patterns.

### Domain Realism: Does your game represent a realistic coordination challenge? Why or why not?

**Yes, the game represents a highly realistic coordination challenge for several reasons:**

**Medical Accuracy**: The scenario accurately reflects real emergency medicine protocols, with authentic medical resources, patient conditions, and treatment priorities that mirror actual hospital emergency departments.

**Time Pressure Realism**: The 15-minute time limit creates genuine urgency that forces rapid decision-making, similar to real emergency situations where seconds matter.

**Resource Scarcity**: The limited resource allocation accurately simulates real-world constraints where medical supplies are finite and must be strategically allocated.

**Interdependence**: The requirement for cross-team coordination mirrors real emergency medicine, where trauma, cardiac, and respiratory teams must work together to save critically ill patients.

**Communication Challenges**: The need to develop efficient communication under pressure reflects real emergency scenarios where teams from different specialties must quickly establish working protocols.

**However, some limitations exist**: The simulation simplifies some aspects of real emergency medicine (e.g., patient deterioration patterns, equipment failures, staff availability) to focus on the core coordination challenge.
